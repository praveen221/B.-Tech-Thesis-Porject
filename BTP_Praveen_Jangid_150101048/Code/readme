readme file for work vanet_simulation.cc 

Work of B.Tech Thesis Project under Dr. Moumita Patra Dept. of CSE IIT Guwahati by Praveen Jangid Roll = 150101048.

The folder code consists of:
1) readme file
2) mobility.tcl
3) pictiures of the map used to generate mobility.tcl file
4) vanet_simulation.cc file

Mobility.tcl file is for node number 50 and map GS Road Guwahati which is also in the folder.


Prerequisite. 
Setup NS3 latest version 
Setup Sumo and OSM Webwizard (Avoid using sudo apt install sumo, use cloning to avoid issues)
Details of softwares used: 
a) ns-3.29
b) sumo 1.2.0 
c) OSM - Open street Map (osmWebWizard.py)


Steps to generate a custom mobility file of your choice 

1) Set SUMO PATH according to the next step below. 
2) open your bash file and add this path "export SUMO_HOME=/home/praveen/sumo/" NOTE : add path according to your home directory.
3) goto tools file inside sump using cd sumo/tools
4) open OSMWebWizard using python osmWebWizard.py
5) use the following command to convert the genrated sumo file to .xml file "sumo -c osm.sumocfg --fcd-output trace.xml"
6) use this command at trace.xml file to convert it into mobility file "python traceExporter.py -i 2019-08-18-20-47-08/trace.xml --ns2mobility-output=/home/praveen/mobility.tcl "

NOTE : The code is already injected with a .tcl mobility file and probability (pcsmafactor) .3 which is best case.

Steps to run the code
1) Copy the code to the scracth folder of your ns3 directory
2) goto line 374 of the code 
3) add your custom file or change the home directory name and path to include the mobility file provided in the folder
4) Keep the setting below same or change for analysing from line 377 to 379    
		m_nMaxNodes = xx;  xx is the number of nodes when you will scroll down the mobility.tcl file 
		m_TotalSimTime = 10.01;
		m_nodeSpeed = 20;
5) Change the name of data files generated according to your choice in lines 381 and 382.
6) Goto line 389 and change pcsmafactor variable according to your choice between 0 to 1. It is already set to .3 by default which is best case.  
6) Save the file.


Go to Terminal

use command ./waf --run scratch/vanet_simulation
